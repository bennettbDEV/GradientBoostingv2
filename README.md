## About The Project
While taking an Intro to AI course at my university, I wanted to go a bit beyond the content presented
and look into an additional machine learning concept. I did some research and found that Gradient Boosting was a commonly used concept that is both accurate and flexible. Subsequently, I decided to make an informal write up about the subject and use the technique to classify emails as spam or non-spam.

## Code Overview

To install the dependencies and run the code for yourself, follow these simple steps in your terminal:

0. (Optionally) Set up a [virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
```sh
python -m venv venv
```
0a. Activate the virtual environment - for Windows:
```sh
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
0b. Activate the virtual environment - for Linux/Mac:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
1. Clone the repo (into the currect directory)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bennettbDEV/GradientBoostingv2.git .
```
2. Install necessary packages
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the program!
```sh
python main.py
